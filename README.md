## üí° About the project

>_The game **Kerby - kd meu bichinho** . The project presendted in this repository is the part of a series of challenges created by the free course platform [Digital Innovation One](https://web.digitalinnovation.one/home)  - JavaScript for Games Bootcamp. <br>
>_Challenge: Develop a game using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementations

In addition to the implementations developed during the class **Building a Ship Game** I developed some additional actions to make the game more fun and necessary to balance the mechanics correctly so that the game is fairer.
* The character can move around the screen using the WASD keys and attacking through Space.
* If enemies lean left, you lose a star.
* If the ally/friend touches enemies, you lose x amount of points.
* You get a star (life) on
* If your rating is <0 you will lose the game instantly.
* Points acquired during the game are added or subtracted at the end (in case you lose your ally/friend) and are displayed at the end of each game.
